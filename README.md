# Medical-Premium-prediction-
Project Objective:
•	“To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts medical insurance premiums based on individual demographic, lifestyle, and medical data.”
•	“To improve pricing accuracy, and identify key risk factors influencing insurance costs, thereby supporting fair and transparent insurance pricing practices and enhancing customer satisfaction.”

Introduction: 
                       Health insurance plays a crucial role in safeguarding individuals, families, and organizations from the financial burdens caused by unforeseen medical events and escalating healthcare costs. With the advent of advanced technologies and the vast availability of data, insurance companies are exploring new avenues to improve their operations and services. This project by the application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in the health insurance sector, enhance the prediction of insurance charges and improve decision-making processes.
Practical Implementation: 
                 There are various insurance agencies with different kinds of premium plans. This will be helpful for predicting the premium cost based on several factors.

About the dataset:
                        Downloaded customer info data about a Medical Insurance company data from Kaggle. This data set contains medical costs of people characterized by certain attributes. There are total of 7 attributes and 1338 records. These customer attributes include: age, gender, BMI, number of children, Smoking habits, and region. We will analyze these customer information to make the best business decisions for the medical insurance company.
